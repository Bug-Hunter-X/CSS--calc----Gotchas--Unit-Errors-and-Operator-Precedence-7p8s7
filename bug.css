The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes produce unexpected results due to unit inconsistencies or incorrect operator precedence.  For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works as expected, but `width: calc(100% - 10);` (missing 'px') will likely fail.  Another common issue is with nested `calc()` functions, where the order of operations might not be what's intended without proper use of parentheses.
